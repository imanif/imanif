👋 Hi, I’m Imani!

🎓 I'm graduating from Cornell University with a BA with Honors in English Literature and a minor in Computer Science.

👀 I’m interested in applied natural language processing and machine learning for digital humanities research. I have worked as both an NLP researcher and CV researcher, and have led projects looking into AI ethics.

🌱 I’m currently researching the effects and possibilities of generative AI media (look at ByAI repository).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will allow me to learn how to analyze the intersection of AI and society.
