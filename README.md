👋 Hi, I’m Imani!

🖥️  I'm a computational linguistics research fellow at the University of Maryland!

👀  I’m interested in applied natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the intersection of AI, media, and society.

🌱  I’m currently researching prompt optimization for long-form text generation and LLM evaluation.
